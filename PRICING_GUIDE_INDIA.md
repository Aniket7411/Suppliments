## üé≠ Negotiation Tips

### When Client Says "Too Expensive"

**Option 1: Reduce Scope**
"I can deliver the buyer side only for ‚Çπ40,000"

**Option 2: Payment Plan**
"We can split into 3 payments: ‚Çπ25k upfront, ‚Çπ25k at 50%, ‚Çπ20k on delivery"

**Option 3: Phased Approach**
"Phase 1 (Frontend): ‚Çπ50,000
Phase 2 (Backend): ‚Çπ80,000
You can start with Phase 1 and add Phase 2 later"

**Option 4: Feature Reduction**
"Without seller dashboard: ‚Çπ45,000
Full version: ‚Çπ70,000"

### When to Walk Away
- Budget less than ‚Çπ25,000 for current work
- Unrealistic timeline (wants everything in 1 week)
- Too many decision makers
- Red flags in communication
- Constant scope changes without payment
