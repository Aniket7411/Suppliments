## 🎭 Negotiation Tips

### When Client Says "Too Expensive"

**Option 1: Reduce Scope**
"I can deliver the buyer side only for ₹40,000"

**Option 2: Payment Plan**
"We can split into 3 payments: ₹25k upfront, ₹25k at 50%, ₹20k on delivery"

**Option 3: Phased Approach**
"Phase 1 (Frontend): ₹50,000
Phase 2 (Backend): ₹80,000
You can start with Phase 1 and add Phase 2 later"

**Option 4: Feature Reduction**
"Without seller dashboard: ₹45,000
Full version: ₹70,000"

### When to Walk Away
- Budget less than ₹25,000 for current work
- Unrealistic timeline (wants everything in 1 week)
- Too many decision makers
- Red flags in communication
- Constant scope changes without payment
